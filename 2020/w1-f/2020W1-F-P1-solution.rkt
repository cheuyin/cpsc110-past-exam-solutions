THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM ARE IN THREE PARTS:

 - WORK TO DO
 - ENTERING YOUR ANSWERS
 - ERRORS AND FAILING TESTS

**WORK TO DO**

This question is about reference arrows in type comments and their corresponding
call arrows in templates.  Download the f-p1-figure.pdf file.  That file shows
two figures, one of a set of type comments with reference arrows; the other is
templates and call arrows.

The arrows in the type comments figure are labeled with the letters A to I.  The
arrows in the templates figure are labeled with the numbers 1 to 9.  In this
problem you have to do three things:

 - For each of the type comment arrows A to I you must determine whether it
   is a reference, self-reference or mutual reference.

 - For each of the call arrows 1 to 9 you must determine whether it is a
   natural helper, natural recursion, or natural mutual recursion.

 - For each of the call arrows 1 to 9 you must determine which of the
   type comment arrows it corresponds to.


**ENTERING YOUR ANSWERS**

You will enter all of your answers into three constant definitions below.  You
must follow the directions below and enter your results EXACTLY as specified
There will be a significant deduction if your file does not run, or if it fails
any of the special tests below that check the format of your answer.  Follow
the instructions in this section, AND read the next section on errors.  Run
your file every time before you hand it in.




In the reference arrows constant you must replace every "???" string with one of
the strings "R" (reference), "SR" (self-reference), or "MR" (mutual reference).

|#


(define reference-arrows
  (list (list "A" "MR")
	(list "B" "MR")
	(list "C" "R")
	(list "D" "MR")
	(list "E" "R")
	(list "F" "MR")
	(list "G" "MR")
	(list "H" "MR")
	(list "I" "SR")))

#|


In the call arrows constant you must replace every "???" string with one of the
strings "NH" (natural helper), "NR" (natural recursion), or "NMR" (natural
mutual recursion).

|#
(define call-arrows
  (list (list 1 "NMR")
	(list 2 "NMR")
	(list 3 "NMR")
	(list 4 "NMR")
	(list 5 "NH")
	(list 6 "NH")
	(list 7 "NMR")
	(list 8 "NMR")
	(list 9 "NR")))

#|


In the correspondences constant you must replace every "???" string with one of
the strings "A" to "I" indicating with reference arrow corresponds to the call
arrow with that line's number.

|#
(define correspondences
  (list (list 1 "H")
	(list 2 "A")
	(list 3 "B")
	(list 4 "D")
	(list 5 "C")
	(list 6 "E")
	(list 7 "F")
	(list 8 "G")
	(list 9 "I")))

ERRORS AND FAILING TESTS

A file that does not run may earn as few as zero marks.  At this point in the
term there is no reason for you to hand in a file that does not run.  Run your
work often while filling in the reference-arrows and call-arrows and you will
have no problem being sure your file runs. Also be sure to run EVERY TIME BEFORE
YOU SUBMIT.

We have special checks (tests) at the end of the file.  Any tests that fail
indicate that you have not understood or followed the instructions on how to
form your answer.  Files that have failing checks may earn as few as zero marks.
IF YOU GET A FAILING CHECK, take the time to CAREFULLY READ THE MESSAGE.  We
have designed these tests so that the name of the failing tests indicates what 
is incorrect.

If you get more than one error or failing test we recommend fixing the first
one and then re-running before trying to fix the later ones.
